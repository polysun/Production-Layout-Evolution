# Production-Layout-Evolution

This project considers an open shop scheduling problem with material flow time, termed OSSMFT. The material flow time is determined by the actual machine layout and transportation speed of material.
We aim to optimize the production layout for a batch of tasks , to optimize the material flow between machines. As a result, the actual makespan is reduced.

We establish a framework termed Production Layout EVolution (PLEV) to solve the PLP-OSSMFT. 
It consists of three key components: initial production layout, production layout assessment, and an evolutionary programming mechanism.

There are three folders, which are datasets,  textual representation of Gantt charts of some cases and experimental results by PLEV.
