The datasets consist of two parts: multi-task production and batch production.

(len,wid) indicates the length and width of the workshop. For example, (len, wid)=(5,5) means that the workshop has 5×5=25 production units.
(m,n) indicates the number of machines and the number of jobs. For example, A1_(m,n)=(20,16) means that the number of machines is 20 and the number of jobs is 16.

Each file contains processing time of all the operations (n rows, m columns). If the processing time is 0, it meansIf the operation does not need to be processed.
